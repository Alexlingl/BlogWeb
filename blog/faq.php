  <h2>Question 1.</h2>
  <p>
   Here is answer1.We've all been taught that we should help people. It is the right thing to do and will make us popular with others. It may even win us favors in return. However, we must be realistic. We can't say yes to every request. If we did, we would fail or go crazy for sure. Sometimes we simply don't have the time to help. In this case, we must know how to say no politely.Here is the answer4.Ambushes in Darfur...Terrorism in Kabul...And a plane crash in Haiti...These were among the tragedies that struck peacekeeping last year, killing 121 people.
  That toll was nearly matched in a few seconds with the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti last January. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti lost 96 peacekeepers -- the biggest single loss of life in peacekeeping history.

  <h2>Question 2.</h2>
  <p>
   Here is the answer2.When we need to say no, here is one method we can try. First, we should tell the truth. If we really can't do something, we should just say so. Second, we should remember to refuse requests politely. We must communicate clearly, but must also be sincere and sympathetic. A true friend will understand. Finally, we must not feel guilty about saying no. Sometimes refusing others is the right thing to do. It can save ourselves, and them, a lot of trouble. In short, we cannot please everyone all the time. Refusing favors is a part of life.
